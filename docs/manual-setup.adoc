= Manual setup on local machine

== Prerequisites
If youâ€™re on macOS, install Homebrew and https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/blob/main/scripts/macos-setup.sh[macos-setup.sh] script to setup all necessary tools.

If you are not on macOS or you don't have Homebrew, you need to install:

- Go compiler, at least 1.16
- Geth (Ethereum client) 1.10.3-stable
- Solidity, at least 0.5.17
- Protobuf compiler, at least 3.11.4
- `protoc-gen-gogoslick` toolchain
- `jq`

Regardless you use `macos-setup.sh` or not, you should also install:

- https://docs.docker.com/get-docker[Docker] & https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose]
- https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install[Yarn]
- https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv], at least 1.2.18 (optional - only if testnet relay is used)
- https://github.com/pypa/pipenv[pipenv], at least 2018.11.26 (optional - only if testnet relay is used)

== Node.js version notice

Please use Node `v15.8.0` for everything but E2E test script.
To run the test script, please use Node `v14.17.0`.

We recommend using https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[nvm] to manage node versions easily.
You can install both versions by doing:
```
$ nvm install 11.15.0
$ nvm install 14.17.0
```
And use the specific version:
```
$ nvm use 11.15.0
$ nvm use 14.17.0
```

== Installing the system
. Initialize local `geth` using:
+
```
$ ./initialize-geth.sh
```
+
You can skip this step if your local geth is already initialized. This script clears all Ethereum client data, initilizes genesis block, and funds five accounts. All client data are kept in the working directory of this project so all the data used for other projects stay untouched.

. Run local `geth` node using:
+
```
$ ./run-geth.sh
```
. Initialize bitcoin using:
+
```
$ ./initialize-bitcoin.sh
```
You can skip this step if your local bitcoin is alread initialized.

. Run local Bitcoin Core node and ElectrumX using:
+
```
$ ./run-bitcoin.sh
```
. Run Keep & tBTC installation script:
+
```
$ ./install.sh
```
+
This script will fetch `keep-core`, `keep-ecdsa`, `tbtc` and `coverage-pools`
source code, deploy contracts of `keep-core`, `keep-ecdsa`, `tbtc` and
`coverage-pools`. It will also build `keep-core` and `keep-ecdsa` off-chain clients.
+
Keep in mind that `coverage-pools` depend on `tbtc`, `tbtc` depends on
`keep-ecdsa` and `keep-ecdsa` depends on `keep-core`.
+
If you decide to update `coverage-pools`, you can run `install-coverage-pools.sh`.
+
If you decide to update `tbtc`, you can run `install-tbtc.sh` followed by
`install-coverage-pools.sh`.
+
If you decide to update `keep-ecdsa`, you can run `install-keep-ecdsa.sh`
followed by `install-tbtc.sh` and `install-coverage-pools.sh`.
+
If you decide to update `keep-core`, you have to run `install-keep-core.sh`
followed by `install-keep-ecdsa.sh` followed by `install-tbtc.sh` followed by
`install-coverage-pools.sh` or just run the entire `install.sh` again.

== Run clients
The above installation script will configure:

- 1 `keep-core` client
- 3 `keep-ecdsa` clients

To run the `keep-core` client use:
```
$ ./run-core-1.sh
```

It is enough to run one `keep-core` client to generate a group and produce relay entries. Setting up more than one client locally is possible but consumes more resources.

To run `keep-ecdsa` clients use:
```
$ ./run-ecdsa-1.sh
```
```
$ ./run-ecdsa-2.sh
```
```
$ ./run-ecdsa-3.sh
```

There are at least 3 `keep-ecdsa` clients needed to open a keep. Setting up more than three clients locally is possible but consumes more resources.

== Beacon genesis

Before the beacon is able to produce a first relay entry, genesis needs to happen. Genesis triggers the first random beacon group selection.

Genesis should be triggered after `keep-core` client started with:
```
$ cd keep-core
$ KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD="password" ./keep-core --config configs/config.local.1.toml relay genesis
```

Bonded ECDSA keep factory from `keep-ecdsa` contracts requests for new relay entry to reseed after each signer selection but it is also possible to request for a new relay entry manually with:
```
$ cd keep-core
$ KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD="password" ./keep-core --config configs/config.local.1.toml relay request
```

== How to interact with the system

You can interact with the system through the tBTC dApp or automated
end-to-end tests. Before you start interacting, make sure you:

- Installed all system components using `install.sh` script
- Have a local Geth instance (`run-geth.sh`) working
- Have local Bitcoin Core and ElectrumX instances (`run-bitcoin.sh`) working
- Have 1 `keep-core` and 3 `keep-ecdsa` clients up and running

=== Keep Dashboard dApp

To run the Keep Dashboard dApp invoke:
```
$ ./run-keep-dashboard.sh
```

=== tBTC dApp

To run the tBTC dApp against the local Bitcoin network invoke:
```
$ ./run-tbtc-dapp.sh
```

=== Testing the Deposit/Redemption Flow

Now that we have everything in place:

* Geth, bitcoin, and electrumx running
* keep-core and 3 ecdsa client running
* the tBTC dApp running

We want to be able to test the deposit/redemption flow.

First, we need a way to send bitcoins to the deposit address:

```
$ npm install -g ./bitcoind-wallet
```

Second, we need an ethereum wallet like metamask (this section will assume that's
what we're using - it can be installed as a browser extension).

Add a new ethereum network with the following parameters to your wallet:
```
name: Keep-Local (can be whatever you want)
rpc url: http://localhost:8545
chain id: 1101
currency symbol: ETH
```

The above is accomplishable in metamask by opening up the browser extension,
clicking the 3 dots in the top right, hitting expand view, clicking the network
dropdown in the top right, and selecting "Custom RPC".

Switch your wallet to use this network, and then navigate to the tBTC dApp (http://localhost:3000)

In metamask, go to "My Accounts" section (click on the colorful circle in the
top-right corner) and choose "Import Account". Choose "JSON File" as type,
navigate to file:
`local-setup/ethereum/data/keystore/UTC--2019-08-01T13-12-46.081900000Z--3d373d872b7ba29d92ed47caa8605b4dd6ec84ef`,
type in "password" as password and click "Import".

Press the deposit button in the dApp, connect your newly imported wallet, and pick a lot size.

Confirm all of the transactions through your wallet, and eventually you will be
presented with a prompt to send BTC to an address.

Copy the address and then run:

```
$ bitcoind-wallet sendToAddress <wallet-address-from-the-website> <lot-size>
# example: bitcoind-wallet sendToAddress bcrt1ra67pwcr96pvv05nt8mhvfanr73lg2zl9w7k5zr 0.5
```

Confirm all of the ethereum transactions with your wallet until it completes.

Note the TDT ID that the dApp gives you
(0x530D37eD3E2194EC1671DD2E153A03FCED5F80cD was mine). This will be
used in the redemption flow.

To see how much TBTC you have, add a custom token to your wallet with the address from the result of:

```
$ cat tbtc/solidity/build/contracts/TBTCToken.json | jq '.networks["1101"].address'
```
(mine was `0xF355D8f5Dca13CE5019675f5f2b2bD821b9A40b9`)

In order to test the redemption flow, you need an amount of TBTC equal to
the lot size, which you won't currently have if you've only deposited once (due
to fees). So, deposit more BTC using the same process as above. Then, once you
have enough TBTC in your wallet to cover a deposit, press the Redeem button, and plug
in one of your TDT IDs (mine was 0x530D37eD3E2194EC1671DD2E153A03FCED5F80cD).

Generate a bitcoin wallet address by running:
```
$ bitcoind-wallet getNewAddress
```

(mine was `bcrt1q2c5ntlx6qddwfppqdk06hzv0hgj36mdk6zpjrt`)

Confirm all of the transactions and verify that the TBTC has left your wallet. You did it!

=== Troubleshooting

* If you're getting an error initiating the deposit, try resetting your wallet in metamask
  (top right -> Settings -> Advanced -> Reset Account)
* If you see an error coming from npm complaining about dependencies (e.g. babel-cli),
  try deleting `package-lock.json` (e.g. if npm cannot find file
  `local-setup/tbtc/solidity/node_modules/.staging/@keep-network/keep-ecdsa-64660964/node_modules/@babel/cli`,
  delete `package-lock.json` file located in `local-setup/tbtc/solidity`) and run
  the script again.
* If you cannot execute commands with bitcoind-wallet, make sure you switched to
  version 15.8.0 of nvm.
* If you pressed "Deposit" and got Unhandled Rejection error from dApp, make sure
  the wallet is connected to your local ethereum network (in metamask go to
  My Accounts->Settings->Networks, Chain Id for localhost:8545 should be 1101).

=== E2E tests

To run the automated end-to-end scenario switch to Node 14.17.0:
```
$ nvm use 14.17.0
```
Then invoke:
```
$ ./run-e2e-test.sh
```
